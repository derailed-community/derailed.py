# derailed.py 

derailed.py is the official Community Python API wrapper for Derailed's API.

## Summary 

**WARNING: This is a pretty long sabbatical detailing a bunch of my experiences.**

As a person who started Python development with Discord Bots, then further down Discord API wrappers, I've always had good knowledge of what developers want in an API wrapper.

Discord.py, the base of most of the API wrappers I've developed had faced many criticisms, not on ease of use or even user-friendliness, but internally.
It's both slow because of many inefficiencies, and fast because of some speedups.
That's the reason I first started the development of Pycord v3 in August, mostly to eliminate these inefficiencies and it's also the reason why nextcord v3 exists.

Derailed.py as of day 1 will be entitled to all of the requirements and such I've put on my previous projects and more. By far, this is my most important API wrapper project because of its potential to work directly with the platform developers themselves.
Other than that we are committed to safety, both with type safety and test safety.

I want as a standard for all the things people want in an API wrapper for a chat app to be in derailed.py. Period.
